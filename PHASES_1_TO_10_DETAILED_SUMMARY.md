2) Tenant-aware Rate Limiting
   - backend/rate_limiter.py token bucket with refill.

3) Enforcement and Headers
   - backend/middleware/tenant.py enforcement; X-RateLimit-* and X-Quota-* headers.

4) Audit Integration
   - backend/auth.py audit_event helper with PII redaction.

5) Retention and Legal Hold
   - backend/tasks.py retention_purge_job honoring legal_hold.

6) Provider SLAs and Status
   - provider_manager health computation and /api/providers/status endpoint.

7) Billing (Sandbox)
   - /api/billing/webhook with idempotency.

8) Admin APIs
   - tenant plans/assign/effective/legal_hold and audit export routes.

9) Wiring and Tests
   - app blueprint registration and before_request enforcement hooks.
   - backend/tests for plans/rate limiter/audit chain/enforcement.

10) Governance Documentation
   - docs/governance/policies.md covering plans, limits, quotas/headers, audit/export, retention/hold, billing, provider status.

Outcomes:
- Plan-based access and enforcement with observable headers.
- Append-only audit log with export and retention job scaffold.
- Provider SLA status and billing webhook idempotency.
- Admin endpoints for plan/tenant and legal hold.

## Current Status Snapshot

Frontend (PWA/Realtime/UX):
- Streaming client and delta bridge integrated; unit/E2E coverage present.
- Service worker supports offline shell; queued write replay with backoff.
- Performance budgets and Lighthouse CI thresholds; CLS/LCP improvements.

Backend (Enterprise Readiness):
- SQLite-backed tenancy, quotas, rate limits; enforcement middleware with headers.
- Audit log append-only with export and retention job respecting legal hold.
- Provider SLA status endpoint; billing webhook idempotency.
- Admin routes for plan management and legal hold.

Risks:
- SQLite default; production needs Postgres or equivalent with migrations.
- Rate-limit remaining header approximates bucket; needs precision.
- Retention job scheduling and billing reconciliation job are pending.
- Additional audit coverage and centralized redaction policy needed.

## Recommended Next Tasks and Execution Plan

This plan translates the recommended next steps into concrete, incremental work items with exit criteria.

Priority 0 — Baseline Validation (Day 0)
- Run all tests and budgets to capture the current baseline:
  - Frontend unit: `npm run test:js`
  - Budgets: `npm run perf:budgets`
  - Lighthouse CI (local): `npm run pwa:lhci`
  - Backend: `pytest backend/tests`
- Record key metrics (Perf, PWA, LCP, CLS, coverage) into STATUS_REPORT.md.

Priority 1 — Production DB and Migrations (Days 1–2)
- Add DB_URL to backend/settings.py and backend/config.py; retain SQLite fallback.
- Add Alembic (or Flask-Migrate) with initial migration reflecting current schema:
  - plan_definitions, tenant_plans, quota_usage, rate_limits, audit_logs, billing_events, provider_status.
- CI guard to fail when model drift occurs without a migration.
- Docs:
  - backend/README.md: Postgres local setup, migration commands.
  - docs/production-setup.md: environment variables, connection strings, migration workflow.
Exit criteria:
- App boots with Postgres via DB_URL; migrations applied cleanly.
- CI check detects missing migrations.

Priority 2 — Enforcement Precision and Metrics (Days 2–3)
- Rate limiting precision:
  - Extend backend/rate_limiter.py to compute and return exact bucket remaining and reset_at.
  - After_request stamps X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset accurately.
- Metrics:
  - Counters/histograms for rate_limit_allowed, rate_limit_blocked, quota_increment_success/failure (bounded labels: tenant_id, user_id hashed).
  - Ensure backend/metrics.py supports Gunicorn multiprocess via PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR; /metrics enabled behind feature flag.
- SW metrics:
  - Expose counters for queued writes, replay successes/failures (scrapable during test runs or logged as structured events).
Exit criteria:
- /metrics shows new series; headers reflect precise bucket; tests pass.

Priority 3 — Centralized Redaction and Audit Coverage (Days 3–4)
- backend/security/redaction.py:
  - Central map of PII fields; helpers to redact structures; unit tests for non-leakage.
- Apply audit_event to all mutating routes in backend/api/* consistently.
- Integration tests:
  - Verify audit entry creation per mutation; hash chain continuity.
Exit criteria:
- Redaction unit tests green; mutation routes audited; integration tests pass.

Priority 4 — Provider Routing, Circuit Breaker, and Failover (Days 4–5)
- Scheduler:
  - Celery beat or APScheduler to periodically compute provider health.
- Circuit breaker:
  - Wrap provider calls with backend/circuit_breaker; trip thresholds update provider_status.
- Tests:
  - Simulate degraded providers; verify failover and /api/providers/status.
Exit criteria:
- Failover validated; status reflects transitions; tests green.

Priority 5 — Billing Reconciliation (Days 5–6)
- Reconciliation job:
  - Summarize metered usage vs. billing_events; detect drift; export CSV.
- Admin endpoint:
  - GET /api/admin/billing/reconciliation?from=&to= returning JSON+CSV attachment.
- Idempotency tests:
  - Re-post identical webhook events; exactly-once semantics enforced.
Exit criteria:
- Reconciliation report accessible; idempotency tests pass.

Priority 6 — Frontend UX Enhancements Aligned to Phases 9/10 (Days 6–7)
- Scenario diff:
  - Wire active run selection, virtualization for large diffs, keyboard shortcuts.
- Streaming robustness:
  - Playwright E2E for reconnect with burst deltas; assert rAF batching and coalescing.
- Accessibility:
  - ARIA and focus management for diff UI; unit tests for keyboard nav.
Exit criteria:
- E2E confirms robustness; a11y checks pass; UX improvements merged.

Priority 7 — CI/CD, SLOs, and Observability (Days 7–8)
- CI hardening:
  - Stable Lighthouse runs via deterministic throttling and snapshots; strict gate with single rerun policy.
- SLO dashboards:
  - Publish Grafana dashboards (docs/observability) for latency, errors, rate-limit blocks, SW queue metrics.
- Alerts:
  - Adopt docs/observability/alerting_rules.yml for error spikes, rate-limit anomalies, provider degradation.
Exit criteria:
- CI passes reproducibly; dashboards and alerts ready with environment docs.
